# TeamRandomizer

Player objects, holding the player's name and rank, are made beforehand in the start() function.

Will be working on allowing users to add players w/rank themselves :)

Project Goals:

- Made a class-based program implementing inheritance in Python.
- Utilized agile software development methodologies.
- Wrote descriptive docstrings and comments to improve code readability.
- Performed unit testing on codebase by using pythonâ€™s unittest module to assert that the logic of the program is correct.

Program running:
