# TeamRandomizer

Takes a list of player names and balances them into 2 teams based on ranks. Players and ranks are added to the class beforehand.
Will be working on this in the future to allow users to add players w/rank :)

Project Goals:

- Made a class-based program implementing inheritance in Python.
- Utilized agile software development methodologies.
- Wrote descriptive docstrings and comments to improve code readability.
- Performed unit testing on codebase by using pythonâ€™s unittest module to assert that the logic of the program is correct.

Program running:
